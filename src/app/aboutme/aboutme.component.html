    <!-- <h1>Software Developer</h1>
    <p>I am a software developer who is very passionate about creating products that solve real world problems. I thrive working in a dynamic team environment that promotes growth, teamwork, and development.</p> -->
     <h1>My Silicon Valley Story</h1>
    <p>My journey into software development began at a very young age. My family settled into Silicon Valley and was part of the tech revolution after we were displaced during the Vietnam War. My father worked as a engineer and my mom a technician for a bio medical company. Like many families we struggled to adjust culturally and economically but worked hard everyday to make a better life for ourselves here.</p>
    <p>My dad taught me from a young age to build, tinker and play with computers. Our first computer was a pentium x486 built by hand before it became more economically prudent to buy computers prepackaged through large companies like dell.</p>
    <p>From a very young age I always enjoy tinkering with new technology, sometimes breaking them to find out how it works and putting them back together. Needless to say this became an expensive hobby, but "that" curiosity never left me, It is part of who I am. Love me or hate me, i break things to learn, but always strive to make them better!
    </p>
    <p>Many years later coding has become an off shoot from my creativity.  Integrating  design, User Interfaces, and code into a working product that others can use drives me everyday. I love the feeling of delivering a finish product to a client. It feels great to see a plan come together. Let's build something!</p>
